* Improved logging for `CBManagerState`

## v1.0.0 - 2021-09-15

### API Changes

* (Renamed) `LockKit.initializeSDK(apiToken:onResult:)` -> 
`LockKit.initializeSDK(sdkToken:onResult:)`
* Fixed an issue where eKey wouldn't be properly cleared on `LockKit.finalizeLock`
* Fixed an issue where calling `LockKit.finalizeLock` during an ongoing lock action would
  prevent the ongoing action result from being delivered

## v0.5.4 - 2021-08-20

* Fix an internal bluetooth manager wouldn't be properly initialized on
`LockKit.initializeSDK(apiToken:)` call.

## v0.5.3 - 2021-08-20

## v0.5.2 - 2021-08-19

## v0.5.1 - 2021-08-13

## v0.5.0 - 2021-08-03

### API Changes

* `StatusUpdate.waitingForUserAction` is not called when unlocking. This was
  here to support old lock hardware that is no longer in use.
* Improved `LockKit.initializeSDK(apiToken:)` by using a full `onResult` handler
  instead of just an error handler.

## v0.4.0 - 2021-06-30

### API Changes

* (Renamed) `LockKit.endRental(lockName:onStatusChanged:onResult:)` ->
  `LockKit.prepareEndRental(lockName:onStatusChanged:onResult:)` to clearly
  indicate that the method does not actually end a rental.
* (Removed) `LockError.invalidCommand` which at this time wasn't reported at all.

## v0.3.0 - 2021-06-22

### API Changes

* (Renamed) `LockKit.initializeLock(lockName:eKey:commands:)`
  -> `LockKit.initializeLock(lockName:eKey:passkey:)`. It now takes a single
  string as `passkey`, instead of a list of strings, and manages commands
  parsing internally.
* (Renamed) `LockKit` namespace was removed from the following enums and structs:
  - `ServerEnvironment`
  - `LogLevel`
  - `StatusUpdate`
  - `InitializeSDKError`
  - `InitializeLockError`
  - `FinalizeLockError`
  - `LockError`

## v0.2.0 - 2021-06-11

* Require the first unlock to be performed while online.
* Add `LockKitConfiguration.environment` to select between live and test
  environment.
